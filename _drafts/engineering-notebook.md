* all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. In my case, GitHub.
* static pages using content generation. No databases, no application server. Even though those things are awesome.
* use something incredibly simple and fast which allows me to focus more on the writing process and good content and less on _how to make it work_
* one more way to become an expert in Markdown. I know that sounds silly but this is one of my goals for 2015. While I already know Markdown I have to look things up quite a bit. I want that to be over.

Site built using:
* Atom
* GitHub / GitHub Pages
* Jekyll

>First, all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. This would ensure that I could try out different ideas and explore a variety of posts all from the comfort of my preferred editor and the command line. I’d be able to publish a post via a simple deploy script or post-commit hook. Complexity would be kept to an absolute minimum, so a static site would be preferable to a dynamic site that required ongoing maintenance. My blog would need to be easily customizable; coming from a graphic design background means I’ll always be tweaking the site’s appearance and layout.
