  This simple website is designed to be an engineering notebook of sorts.
  Not really a blog but more of a place to write engineering notes or various
  ideas that are helpful to me and perhaps others.
# If you're hosting your site at a Project repository on GitHub pages
# (http://yourusername.github.io/repository-name)
# and NOT your User repository (http://yourusername.github.io)
# then add in the baseurl here, like this: "/repository-name"
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
# Your website URL (e.g. http://aaronwest.github.io or http://www.aaronwest.net)
# Used for Sitemap.xml and your RSS feed
url: http://aaronwest.github.io
