This simple website is designed to be an engineering notebook of sorts. Not really a blog but more of a place to write engineering notes or various ideas that are helpful to me and perhaps others.

The website is managed by Aaron S. West using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). If you encounter any issues or you have suggestions for ways I can improvement the site please [file an issue here](https://github.com/aaronwest/aaronwest.github.io/issues).
